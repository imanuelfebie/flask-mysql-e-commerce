#### Setup instructions
This project is build using [Flask](https://palletsproject.com/p/flask), a lightweight WSGI web application framework. In order to run this web app on your local machine you need to have the following packages installed on your system:

- Python 3.8
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest) (it's always advised to create your python projects inside virtual environments)

If both of these are installed on you system you can simply clone the project `git clone https://github.com/imanuelfebie/flask-mysql-e-commerce.git`. Change into the project directory and run `pipenv install`. This will install all the python packages that are required for this to be able to run:

- flask
- flask-mysqldb

Run the development server with `python run.py` and you can view the web app on  `localhost:5000`.
